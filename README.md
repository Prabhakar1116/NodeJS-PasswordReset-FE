This is the front end for the Password Reset task for Nodejs:

1. In this task the user needs to register first and then login.

2. If you forgot the password then click forgot password and enter your email a password reset link will be sent to your login address

3. Click the link and then enter the new  password and then login

Note: This is an old task which is reused for my ease of use and added the additional concepts which are needed for the current task

The concept of the task is given below

--> The cards titles  are given in App.jsx and imported to cards.jsx

--> The cards are done in cards.jsx and imported to App.jsx

--> The cards are styled using bootstrap

--> The Navbar contains the cart icon along with the number of items

--> The number in the cart icon is linked to the Card.jsx suchthat if a Add to cart button is clicked,
the number in the cart icon increases by 1 and so on and the vice-versa for remove from cart.

--> The cart icon is linked to the cart.jsx which contains the items added to the cart.

--> The cart is done using bootstrap.
